# Zone Weaver Frontend (M2)

React + Tailwind UI for the Zone Weaver platform.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the app in the browser
   - http://localhost:5173

## Backend integration

The frontend is configured to connect to the Zone Weaver backend at:

- `https://hex-zone-server.onrender.com/`

You can also override the API base URL using the environment variable:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

### Guest session (approved anonymous guests)

**Backend handoff:** copy or share **`docs/BACKEND_ACCESS_ZONE_FULL_CONTRACT.md`** with the API team — it summarizes Access Zone messaging (PERMISSION / CHAT), guest JWT routes, **`GET /api/access/guest-requests`**, **`GET .../peers`**, and `POST /messages` with **`guest_id`**, aligned with the Access Zone propagation PDF set.

Coordinate your API release: extended `GET` access session poll (`APPROVED` may include `exchange_code` / `exchange_expires_at`), `POST /api/access/guest-session`, and authenticated `/api/guest/*` (`/me`, **`/zones/{id}/peers`** (critical for guest Messaging), `/messages`, optional `/zones/{id}/dashboard`). This client does not pin a server semver.

When the backend implements the guest contract (session poll may return `exchange_code` when status is `APPROVED`), the client exchanges that code at `POST /api/access/guest-session`, stores the returned JWT in **session storage** under `zoneweaver_guest_access_token`, and uses it only for `/api/guest/*` routes via a dedicated axios instance (never mixed with the member `zoneweaver_token`).

Configure paths if your router differs (see `.env.example`):

- `VITE_GUEST_SESSION_EXCHANGE_URL` (default `/api/access/guest-session`)
- `VITE_GUEST_API_BASE_PATH` (default `/api/guest`)

Guest UI routes: `/guest/dashboard`, `/guest/messages`. Until the backend ships these endpoints, exchange or guest calls may 404; the UI surfaces errors where relevant.

Member **Messages** compose for **PERMISSION** and **CHAT** uses the guest list from `GET` guest-requests for the zone and sends `guest_id` on `POST /messages` (not `receiver_id`). **PRIVATE** still uses owner `receiver_id`. Align field names with your server if needed.

## Testing

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Project structure

- `src/components` — reusable UI pieces
- `src/pages` — application screens
- `src/hooks` — auth and API helpers
- `src/lib` — API client and H3 utilities

## Notes

- Dark teal theme with hex-style UI accents
- H3 grid and polygon zone builder powered by `h3-js` and `react-leaflet`
- JWT login stored in `localStorage`
